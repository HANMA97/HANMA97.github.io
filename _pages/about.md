Welcome to my homepage! I am currently a fourth-year PhD student in Electronic Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, where I am fortunately being advised by Prof. [Max Q.-H. Meng](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/en-gb/people/academic-staff/chairman/30-prof-qing-hu-max-meng). Before that I got my B.S.E. at Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2019.

My research interest lies broadly in Robotics and deep learning, with emphasis in path planning and deep learning in robotics.
