Welcome to my homepage! I am currently working as an Autonomous Driving Algorithm Engineer in [the Department of Autonomous Vehicle Delivery at Meituan](https://mad.meituan.com/), based in Shenzhen, China. I earned my Ph.D. in 2023 from the Department of Electronic Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, where I had the privilege of being advised by Professor [Max Q.-H. Meng](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/en-gb/people/academic-staff/chairman/30-prof-qing-hu-max-meng). Prior to that, I completed my Bachelor of Science in Engineering (B.S.E.) at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China, in 2019.

In my current role, I focus on designing and enhancing decision-making and planning algorithms for autonomous driving vehicles. Prior to graduating, my research interests centered on robotics and deep learning, with a particular emphasis on path planning and the application of deep learning in robotics.
